* IRCSlackBridge

* WORK IN PROGRESS

** Installation

Standard python bs:

#+begin_src sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
#+end_src

** Setup

IRCSlackBridge creates a single RTM connection to Slack, and once it's
connected opens an unauthenticated IRC server on localhost:6667. It
will accept multiple IRC connections, but they will all "connect" to
the same Slack session. If the Slack connection drops, the bridge
should die and be restarted (by supervisord or w/e).

Generate a key for your account on the [[https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens][legacy tokens]] page, then put it
into the SLACK_API_TOKEN environment variable and you're good to go.
